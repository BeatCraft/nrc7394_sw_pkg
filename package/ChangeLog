Change summary for version 1.1:

    New features
      * GPIO configuration for deep sleep
          o Host mode (Build-time configuration)
            - build-time configuration by editing in nrc-vendor.h
              : TARGET_DEEP_SLEEP_GPIO_DIR
                TARGET_DEEP_SLEEP_GPIO_OUT
                TARGET_DEEP_SLEEP_GPIO_PULLUP
          o Host mode (Run-time configuration)
            - run-time configuration by cli_app
              : cli_app set deepsleep_gpio <dir> <out> <pullup>
	    * Support preferred BSS Max Idle period of STA on AP

    Bugfix
      * Unstable power consumption under deep sleep mode
      * Duplicate TIM checking
      * AP's downlink throughput is abnormally high under LBT condition of KR domain
      * AP sends 1/2/4M probe response frame according to bandwidth of probe request from STA
      * Delayed response for 'iw scan' command under the heavy traffic
      * Multicast frame's SN is not sequential when duty cycle is on
      * Kernel panic caused when beacon_bypass_enable of start.py is 1
      * Invalid secondary CCA on JP 2/4MHz channels
      * Occaionsal WDT reset occurs when performing frequent ifconfig up/down operations on AP
      * 1MHz primary channel location compliance issue: device should follow the location of the 1MHz primary channel
      * frame format compliance issue: the same frame format should be used within a single frame sequence
      * RI of RTS compliance issue: legacy CTS frame format was used in open mode AP

    Changes
      * Update cli_app commands: refer to UG-7394-007-Commnad line application document
      * Update KR/CN channels: refer to UG-7394-003-S1G_Channel document
      * Enable MIC detection in the mesh device on KR-USN5 band
      * Apply 128usec CS time and 2sec pause time for all JP channels
      * Duty cycle 2.8% support only for EU STA
      * Support kernel 6.1.21 (32-bit/64-bit)
      * Support iwconfig wlan0 frag <threshold value>
      * Add vendor IE in probe request/respone and assoc request frames
  		* Add retransmission scheme about sending QoS Null with PM1 for power save operation
      * Optimize the initialization process of uCode
      * Change module parameter of the host driver for the configuration of A-MPDU (0:disable, 1:manual, 2:auto(default))
      * Support 'iw scan' command on the mesh node

    Known Issues
      * In multi-hop mesh network, DHCP may experience delays or failures. 
        It is recommended to use static IP addresses for networks with more than three hops.
      * Using a short guard interval on 1 or 2 MHz channels can lead to degraded performance.
      * WDT reset recovery is not supported on MAP.
      * The issue of deauthentication frame delivery failure can occur 
        between PMF-enabled NRC7394 and PMF-enabled NRC7292 devices.

    Known Issues
      * In multi-hop mesh network, DHCP may experience delays or failures. 
        It is recommended to use static IP addresses for networks with more than three hops.
